PyPhysEd is a program to measure motion for physics experiments. This the development version and is primarily designed to measure the motion of the pendulum.

Dependencies:
PyQt4
PyQwt
python bindings for opencv
numpy
matplotlib

To run: 
python PyPhysEd.py

File-> Input -> 
       File = Open file
       Cam = Use webcam
       Exit = Quit

Tools ->
      Tracking = Parameters for point detection and tracking.
      Update = Update parameters

Plot -> graphing options

Start buttom -> Start/ stop video capture

Pause first frame -> does just that.   

To add point to track click left mouse button of point and red circle should appear. DEL/backspace removes the point. Can track any number of points but currently only plots the first.
